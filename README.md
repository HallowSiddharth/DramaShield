# Drama Shield

Content Filtering Tool for Twitter / X

## Why Drama Shield?

Twitter has always had it's fair share of drama queens and attention seekers. With monetization based on impressions, this has reached an all time high. People are stirring drama just to get more impressions on their tweet and to get followers and or money from this. For people like us, we find this extremely annoying and is impacting our Twitter experience.

## Who is it for?

It's for anyone who want to just enjoy watching interesting tweets without some person creating drama and getting them tensed for no reason.

## What is Drama Shield?

- It deletes tweets of the users u don't like.
- It uses a user list, which you can add or remove users from.
- The tweets of all the users from the user list will be removed from your time line.
- You can add users at any time, and delete users.
- This delete function will run every 3 seconds to handle dynamic updation of your timeline (infite scroll)

## How is this different from the block feature?

Blocking wise, it really isn't different.

But Unblocking wise:
**In Twitter/X, you have to :**

- Click on settings and privacy.
- Click on Privacy and safety.
- Click on Mute and block.
- Click on Blocked accounts.
- Find the account you want to unblock.
- Click the unblock button.

**In Drama Shield:**
You can just click the extension, press the uncheck mark corresponding to the account name.

> Note: Drama Shield doesn't delete tweets if you are in the personal page of that user. It just removes them from the timeline. So if you want to still see their tweets, you can always view their profile.

## What is this NOT?

This is not a shut off tool.
Please don't use this to delete every tweet that doesn't necessarily agree with your opinions. This will eventually end up creating an echo chamber where every tweet you see will seem like it's agreeing with you, simply because you deleted the ones you don't agree with.

> Use Drama Shield responsibly. Use it only for accounts who are either really annoying, or just using twitter to stir up drama, or are having content that you really don't want to see for personal reasons.
